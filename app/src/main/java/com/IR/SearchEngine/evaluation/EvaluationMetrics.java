/**
 * Provides various metrics for evaluating search engine performance.
 * This class implements standard IR evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F-measure, etc.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Calculate precision, recall, and F-measure at different cutoff points
 * - Compute Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
 * - Generate evaluation reports and summaries
 * - Support comparison between different retrieval models
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Should handle edge cases (empty result sets, etc.)
 * - May provide visualization methods for evaluation results
