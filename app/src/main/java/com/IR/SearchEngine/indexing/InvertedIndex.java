/**
 * Represents the inverted index data structure.
 * This class stores the mapping from terms to their postings lists.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Maintain the term-to-postings mapping efficiently
 * - Provide fast lookup operations for query processing
 * - Support index serialization and persistence
 * - Store collection statistics for retrieval models
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Should use efficient data structures for term dictionary
 * - Will leverage Lucene for advanced indexing features
 * - May implement skip lists or other optimizations for postings traversal
