/**
 * Interface defining the contract for text preprocessing components.
 * All text preprocessing implementations should implement this interface.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Define standard methods for text preprocessing operations
 * - Ensure compatibility between different preprocessing implementations
 * - Support configuration of preprocessing parameters
 * - Provide methods for preprocessing both documents and queries
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Should be renamed to interface instead of class
 * - Will be implemented by concrete preprocessors
 * - Will leverage OpenNLP for advanced NLP functionality
