/**
 * Implements the Vector Space Model for document retrieval.
 * VSM represents documents and queries as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Calculate TF-IDF weights for terms in documents and queries
 * - Compute cosine similarity between document and query vectors
 * - Support different term weighting schemes (binary, TF, TF-IDF)
 * - Handle document length normalization
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Should efficiently represent sparse vectors
 * - May implement optimizations for common similarity calculations
