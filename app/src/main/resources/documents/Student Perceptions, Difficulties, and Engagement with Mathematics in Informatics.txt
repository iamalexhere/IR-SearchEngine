Navigating Challenges: Student Perceptions, Difficulties, and Engagement with Mathematics in Informatics
The relationship between informatics students and mathematics is often complex. A significant gap exists between the institutional perspective (mathematics is foundational) and the initial student perspective (mathematics is an unexpected hurdle), which needs to be bridged early and effectively. Universities mandate mathematics because it underpins Computer Science (CS) theory and advanced topics. Students, especially those drawn by the allure of coding or application development, may initially fail to see this connection and perceive mathematics courses as irrelevant obstacles. This mismatch in expectations is a primary source of frustration. Failure to address these challenges and perceptions can lead to higher dropout rates, reduced student motivation, and a superficial understanding of fundamental CS principles, ultimately impacting the quality of future informatics professionals. If students disengage with mathematics due to perceived irrelevance or difficulty , they miss out on foundational knowledge crucial for a deeper understanding of CS. This can lead to them struggling in advanced courses or being limited in their career paths to roles that do not require deep theoretical insight. This document will explore common challenges, varying perceptions of relevance, and factors influencing their engagement and performance in required mathematics courses.
