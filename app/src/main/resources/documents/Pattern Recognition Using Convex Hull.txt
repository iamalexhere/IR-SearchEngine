Pattern Recognition Using Convex Hull
In pattern recognition, convex hulls are employed to extract features from image contours. For example, in handwritten character recognition, the convex hull can describe the global shape of a letter. Comparing the convex hulls of different shapes can reveal structural similarities and is often used to enhance classification accuracy in machine learning models for visual data.
