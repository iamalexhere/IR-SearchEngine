Real-World Applications of Convex Hulls
The convex hull, a fundamental structure in computational geometry, has numerous practical applications. In geospatial mapping, it is used to determine the minimal boundary that encloses a set of geographical points. In clustering and data mining, convex hulls help define the outer limits of datasets, making them valuable for outlier detection and shape analysis in various real-world problems.
