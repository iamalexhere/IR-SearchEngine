Convex Hull in Optimization Problems
Convex hulls play a critical role in linear programming and geometric optimization. Many problems become more tractable when confined within a convex region. For example, in resource allocation or facility location problems, computing the convex hull of all possible positions can significantly reduce the solution space, making optimization algorithms faster and more reliable.
