Mathematical Frontiers: Anticipating Needs for Evolving Informatics Disciplines
As informatics rapidly expands into new domains such as quantum computing, advanced AI ethics, trustworthy AI, and complex systems science, the mathematical toolkit required by professionals and researchers in these fields also needs to broaden and adapt. Emerging informatics fields often tackle problems of unprecedented scale, complexity, or computational paradigms, necessitating a return to, and advancement of, fundamental mathematical principles. Quantum computing is not just faster classical computing; it is based on different mathematical principles (quantum mechanics, linear algebra in complex vector spaces). Trustworthy AI requires new mathematical frameworks for fairness, robustness, and explainability. This is not just an application of old math, but a driver for new mathematical research. Therefore, informatics education must be forward-looking, anticipating these future mathematical needs to prepare students not just for current jobs but for the technological challenges of tomorrow. If curricula focus only on current industry needs, graduates will be unprepared for disruptive technologies like quantum computing or the nuanced demands of AI ethics. Proactive curriculum design is essential.
