Shaping Informatics Professionals: The Evolution of Mathematics Curricula and Pedagogical Approaches
The mathematics curriculum for computer science is not a static entity; it has evolved and continues to be a subject of debate as the field of computing and pedagogical understanding change. The evolution of the mathematics curriculum in Computer Science (CS) reflects the maturation of CS itself as a discipline, moving from merely an auxiliary tool for other sciences to a fundamental science with unique theoretical needs. Initially, CS was often associated with scientific/engineering computation, hence a strong emphasis on calculus. As CS developed its own theoretical core (algorithms, complexity, languages, AI), the need for discrete mathematics, logic, and the like became paramount. Recent calls for more mathematics suggest that new frontiers (AI, data science, quantum computing) are once again expanding these needs. Therefore, informatics programs must be agile in adapting their mathematics curricula to ensure graduates are equipped with mathematical thinking relevant for both current and emerging technological landscapes. If curricula remain static, they risk producing graduates whose mathematical toolkits are outdated for new fields like quantum computing or advanced AI , thereby hampering their ability to innovate.
